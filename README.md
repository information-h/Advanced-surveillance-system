# Advanced Surveillance System Using Multi-Database Facial Recognition & Global CCTV Access

This project aims to create a futuristic surveillance system capable of scanning identities using facial recognition, comparing them against multiple national databases, and reporting unidentified persons to the nearest security agency.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎯 Multi-Database Integration (Criminals, Missing Persons, Watchlist)
- 🌍 Access Global CCTV Cameras via IP stream
- 🧠 AI-based Facial Recognition & Identity Matching
- 🚨 Alerts to Nearest Authorities for Unidentified Persons
- 🧾 Full Logging of Activities with Timestamp

## 📁 Databases

1. **Criminals**
2. **Missing Persons**
3. **Watchlist / Suspects**

Each person in the database has:
- Name
- Unique ID
- Image Path / Facial Data

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology               |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Language      | Python                   |
| Database      | MySQL / SQLite           |
| Facial Recog  | OpenCV + dlib / face_recognition |
| Surveillance  | CCTV/IP Camera Feed (RTSP) |
| UI            | Command Line + Flask (optional) |
| Alerts        | Email / SMS API          |

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-surveillance-system.git
cd advanced-surveillance-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
````

## 📸 Sample Output

![sample-output](screenshots/output1.png)

## 🧪 How it Works

1. Captures live CCTV feed (via IP)
2. Uses AI to detect face in real-time
3. Matches face with 3 databases
4. Sends alert if no match found

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is a **conceptual prototype** for academic/research purposes only. Global CCTV access requires authorized integration with surveillance networks and legal permissions.
